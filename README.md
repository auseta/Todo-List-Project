# Todo-List-Project

This project is about a to-do list. When entering a task in the Inbox section we add the task to a list that will be filtered on 'Today' and 'This Week' if said task matches the date the application is opened and if the date belongs to the current week of the year in which the user opens the application. Also the user can create projects where to store their own tasks for each one.
The application makes use of the localStorage API, so the data persists in the browser when the app is reopened; the date-fns library for date manipulation and webpack to enable module import/export and transpile the code into a js file within a distribution folder.

Languages: JS / HTML / CSS
Tools and Libraries: Bootstrap Icons / date-fns / webpack
